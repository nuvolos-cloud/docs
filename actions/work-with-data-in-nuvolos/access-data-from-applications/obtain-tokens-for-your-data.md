# Obtain tokens for your data

{% hint style="info" %}
You only need to check tokens for your data if your are using non-Nuvolos applications.
{% endhint %}

The credentials to access your data are not your regular Nuvolos credentials. To obtain the required credentials to access data, you need to navigate to the [table view](../the-table-view.md), and click the **CONNECTION GUIDE** button:

The connection guide contains important information if you want to connect to Nuvolos from non-Nuvolos applications:

1. Username is the username with which you can connect to Snowflake.
2. Password is the password - which is not your Nuvolos credential.
3. Finally, a command is provided to simplify your work that contains the database and schema in Snowflake that will hold your data.
