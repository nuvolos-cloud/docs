# Install a Python package

**If you are working with a Python application, e.g. in a Jupyter Lab interface, and you want to install a new package, then you can follow these steps:**

* Open a running application from the list of your applications in your instance \(see the steps detailed [here]() for how to open an application in Nuvolos\). You will see an interface that will look like this

* On the left side, you need to open a new terminal \(as shown in the image\).
* Once in the terminal, install the package using your favorite installation method \(e.g. **pip install something**\).
* If installation was successful, then you are ready to import the installed package and work with it in your Python notebook.
