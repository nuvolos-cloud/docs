# Upload new files

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Uploading files is possible only to the current state of an instance. Before uploading new files, make sure the right privileges are granted: only _instance editors_ are allowed to upload new files to a current state. An _instance editor_ can be contacted for file uploading, or a _space administrator_ can grant editor privileges in the instance.

**To upload new files:**

1. Go to the instance view where you can see the current state and the list of snapshots in an instance. This can be done by clicking on level 3 \(Instance\) from the side bar, or by selecting the instance from the space view. 
2. Go to the current state of the instance. This can be done by selecting the instance from the Space view and then click on **CURRENT STATE** button. 
3. Click on the **UPLOAD** button, and an upload box will appear. 
4. It is possible to drag-and-drop files to the upload box, or to click _Browse_ in order to select local files to upload. 
5. Once files are selected for upload, click on the **UPLOAD FILES** button that appears at the bottom.
