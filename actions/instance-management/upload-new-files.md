# Upload new files

{% hint style="info" %}
Uploading files is possible only to the current state of an instance. You cannot upload files to a snapshot.

Before uploading new files, make sure the right privileges are granted: only _instance editors_ are allowed to upload new files to a current state.
{% endhint %}

**To upload new files:**

1- Open a class, research project, or a dataset from the dashboard. This can be done by clicking on the name of the space.
