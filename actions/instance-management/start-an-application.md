# Work with applications and files

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Before working with files and applications, make sure that you have the right permissions. Only instance editors are allowed to interact and modify applications and files. It is possible to request editor rights from a space administrator. It is also possible to push the contents of an instance to another instance with the right permission setup by requesting the editor of the source instance to  [share](distribute-a-snapshot.md) their content.

## **To start an application:**

1. Navigate to the _current state_ of the selected instance. This can be done by selecting the instance from the Space view and then clicking on **CURRENT STATE** button. 
2. From the side bar on the left, select **Application List.** 
3. If the application list is empty, then it means that no applications have been created yet and one needs to be created. Refer to [here](create-an-application.md) on how to create a new application. 
4. If applications are available in the application list, the following states are possible for each of them:
   *  A **RUNNING** status means that the application can be opened using the **OPEN** button. 
   * A **STOPPED** status means that the application first have to be started by clicking on the **START** button, then opened via the **OPEN** button.
