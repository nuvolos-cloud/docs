# Delete files

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Before deleting a file, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only the editor of an instance is allowed to delete files, otherwise an instance editor needs to be contacted in order for a file to be deleted.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)File deletion is possible from all instances with the exception of the _Distributed_ instance.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Deleting files is possible only if you are working in the current state of the instance.

**To delete a file:**

1.  Navigate to the current state of your instance. This can be done by clicking on level 3 \(Instance\) from the sidebar and then clicking the OPEN CURRENT STATE button. 
2. From the files table, check the files you want to delete. ****
3. Click on the **Delete** button and confirm.
