# Create a snapshot

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Before creating a new snapshot**, make sure that the right permissions are available. Only instance editors are allowed to create new snapshots in their instance. Please contact a space administrator to get appropriate _editor_ privileges.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Upon successful creation of a snapshot**, the browser will be redirected to view the newly created snapshot.

## **There are two options to create a snapshot:**

## **From the instance view**

1. Navigate to the instance view where snapshots of an instance are listed. This can be done by clicking on level 3 \(Instance\) from the side bar. 
2. From the side bar on the left, click on **Add New Snapshot.** 
3. Provide a name of the new snapshot. 
4. Provide a description of the new snapshot. Notice that there is an automatic suggestion that is the description of the current state. 
5. Provide a description of the next work phase: this will be used to update the description of the current state. If no work is expected in the near future, tick the "No work is expected in the next stage" box. 
6. Click on the **Add Snapshot** button. 

## **From the current state view**

Navigate to the instance view where snapshots of an instance are listed. This can be done by clicking on level 3 \(Instance\) from the side bar.

* Click on the **OPEN CURRENT STATE** button. 
* A button with multiple options is visible in the top toolbar. Select **Create Snapshot** and click on the button. 
* Provide a description of the new snapshot. Notice that there is an automatic suggestion that is the description of the current state.

* Provide a description of the next work phase: this will be used to update the description of the current state. If no work is expected in the near future, tick the "No work is expected in the next stage" box.

* Click on the **Add Snapshot** button.
