# Delete a snapshot

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Before deleting a snapshot, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only the editor of an instance is allowed to delete a snapshot in that instance, otherwise an instance editor needs to be contacted in order for a snapshot to be deleted.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Upon successfully deleting a snapshot, the web browser will be redirected to the view where the snapshots in the current instance are displayed.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Snapshot deletion is possible from all instances with the exception of the _Distributed_ instance.

**To delete a snapshot:**

1.  Open the snapshot which you want to delete. This can be done by clicking on level 3 \(Instance\) from the sidebar and selecting the snapshot from the _Archived Snapshots_. Note that the current state cannot be deleted. 
2. From the sidebar on the left, click on **Delete Snapshot.** 
3. Click on the **Delete Snapshot** button and confirm.
