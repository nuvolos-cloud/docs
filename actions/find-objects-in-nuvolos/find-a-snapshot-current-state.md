# Find a Snapshot/Current State

## To find a snapshot/Current State of an instance:

#### 1. Find the instance you want to work in.

If you have already found the instance, go to step 2. Otherwise, check the instructions [here](find-an-instance.md) on how to find an instance

#### 2. To navigate to the current state, there are two options:

**2.1**  If you are still in the space view where the instances are visualized, then you can click on **OPEN CURRENT STATE** to navigate to the current state of the selected instance.
