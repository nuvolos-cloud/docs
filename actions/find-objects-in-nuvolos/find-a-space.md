# Find a space

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)As a DataHub user, you will be able to see only the spaces of which you are an administrator or a viewer.

## To find a space:

#### 1. Find the organization where the space is located.

Select from the Dashboard the organization that contains the space and click on the organization name. For information on how to find an organization, check the instructions available [here](find-an-organization.md).

#### 2. Search for your space.



**If you are encountering a problem finding a space, refer to the troubleshooting guide** [**here**](../../troubleshooting/authorization-issues/cannot-see-a-space.md)**.**
