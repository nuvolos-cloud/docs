# Invite instance users

{% hint style="info" %}
* At the instance level, there are two types of permission that can be granted: instance editor and instance viewer. For details on the types of rights each of these roles has, please read [here](../../data-organization/instances.md).
* Before granting access rights to an instance, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only space administrators are allowed to grant access right for an instance.
{% endhint %}

## **To invite a new instance user:**

1- From the toolbar breadcrumbs, select the space and instance you want to invite users to. For example, let's say that we are working in a the space "Demo Space" and we want to invite an instance editor to the Master instance of this space.
