## **To invite a new instance user:**

1- Open a space \(using the breadcrumbs in the toolbar\).

2- From the overview screen, click on "Course Users" \(if education space\), "Project Users" \(research space\), or "Dataset Users". Assume we are in a class called Demo Space and we want to invite a user as an editor of the Master instance.

5- Select the role you want to assign to the new users. Two options are available: instance editor and instance viewer.

6- Provide a list of emails of the users to invite.
