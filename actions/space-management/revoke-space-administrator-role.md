# Revoke space administrator role

{% hint style="info" %}
A space administrator can revoke or deactivate space administrators.

* **Revoke** will simply revoke the space role from the user. User account and instances/snapshots are not deleted, only the affected users won't see them anymore.
* **Deactivate** blocks user login, so it's a user-global operation.
{% endhint %}

## To revoke or deactivate a space administrator:

1- Open the space you want to revoke the administrator role from \(using the breadcrumbs in the toolbar\).

2- From the overview screen, click on "Course Users" \(if education space\), "Project Users" \(research space\), or "Dataset Users".
