# Delete an instance

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Before deleting an instance, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only the editor of an instance is allowed to delete it, otherwise an instance editor needs to be contacted in order for an instance to be deleted.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Contingent on successful instance deletion, the web browser will be redirected to the view where the instances in the current space are displayed.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)The instances called _master_ and _distributed_ cannot be deleted. The only way to delete them is by deleting the space they are part of.  


**To delete an instance:**

1.  Open the instance which you want to delete. This can be done by clicking on level 2 \(Space\) from the side bar and selecting the instance. 
2. From the sidebar on the left, click on **Delete Instance.** 
3. Click on the **Delete Instance** button and confirm.



#### If you are encountering a problem deleting a space, refer to the troubleshooting guide [here](../../troubleshooting/authorization-issues/cannot-delete-an-instance.md).
