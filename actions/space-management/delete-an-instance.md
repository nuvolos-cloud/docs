# Delete an instance

{% endhint %}

## **To delete an instance:**

1- Open the space where the instance is located \(using the breadcrumbs in the toolbar\).

2- From the overview screen, click on "Course Users" \(if education space\), "Project Users" \(research space\), or "Dataset Users". Assume we are in a class called Demo Space and we want to invite a user as an editor of the Master instance.
