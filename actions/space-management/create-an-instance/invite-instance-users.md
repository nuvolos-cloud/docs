# Invite instance users

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)At the instance level, there are two types of permission that can be granted: instance editor and instance viewer. For details on the types of rights each of these roles has, please read [here](../../../data-organization/instances.md).

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)Before granting access rights to an instance, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only space administrators are allowed to grant access right for an instance.

## **To invite a new instance user:**

1. Find and select the instance you want to invite users to. For instructions on how to find an instance, check the documentation available [here](../../find-objects-in-nuvolos/find-an-instance.md). 
2. From the sidebar on the left, click on **Invite Instance Users.** 
3. Select the type of invitation you want to send \(Editors or Viewers\) 
4. Provide the emails of the users you want to invite to the instance. 
5. Click on invite.
