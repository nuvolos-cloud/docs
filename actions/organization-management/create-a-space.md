# Create a space

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Before creating a space,** make sure that the right permissions are set. Only organization managers and faculty members are allowed to create new spaces. A faculty member or organization manager needs to be contacted in order for a new space to be set up.  

![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Space creation is a three-step process:** first you create a space, then you will be asked to create an application, and finally a set of options is displayed to decide on the next step.

## To create a new space

 1- Navigate to the dashboard.

2- Scroll down where you can see Spaces. On the right, you will see two buttons called **+ NEW CLASS,** to create a space to teach a class, and **+ NEW RESEARCH PROJECT** for a research space. Click on one of the two buttons.

3- Provide a name and a description of the new space in the respective fields. 

4- Click "Add Space" and wait a few seconds.

4- Create an application by selecting the application type, version, name, and optionally a description.

5- Click "Add Application" and wait a few seconds.

6- Select the next step from the options displayed.
