# Dataset viewer

Very often, invited users are granted automatic 'observer' roles to public datasets in the organization. Observers are not allowed to see and interact with the contents of datasets, therefore, they need to ask for a viewer role.

To ask for a viewer role in a public dataset:

1- Open the dataset from the toolbar menu.

2- From the overview page, click on REQUEST ROLE.
