# Delete a space

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only space administrators have the ability to delete a space. Deleting a space will remove all content in it, including all instances and data contained in all instances. \
\
**This operation might impact a large number of users.**
{% endhint %}

## **To delete a space:**

1- Open the space by selecting it from the toolbar breadcrumbs or from the dashboard. For example, let's say we want to delete a space called "Demo Space". Clicking on 'Demo Space' vwill take us to the overview view.
