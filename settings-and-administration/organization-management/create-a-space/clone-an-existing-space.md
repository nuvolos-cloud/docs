# Clone an existing space

When creating a new space, you can use the 'Clone an existing space' switch on the creation screen to select which existing space should be used as a template to the new one. The contents of the Current State of the Master instance will be cloned to the Current State of the Master instance of the new space. No access privileges, snapshots or other instances will be cloned.

Type a name for the course and a short description, then pick the resource pool to be used. Click the 'Create space based on a template' switch to activate it:

Click 'Clone an existing space' dropdown where you can look up the space to use as a template. **You need to have space administrator role in a space to select it as template.** When all the required information is entered, click the now active 'Clone space' button:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Space visibility and readme files are unavailable when a space is created based on an other. Both of these will be copied over from the template to the newly created one.
{% endhint %}

The space will be created for you immediately, however the cloning process will happen in the background. You can check its progress under User Notification/Tasks.
