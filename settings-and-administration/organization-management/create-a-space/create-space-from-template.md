# Create space from template

Space admins can use the 'Create space based on a template' switch on the creation screen to select which existing space should be used as a template to the new one.

Type a name for the course and a short description, then pick the resource pool to be used. Click the 'Create space based on a template' switch to activate it:

![Creating space based on a template](../../../.gitbook/assets/find\_the\_clone\_switch.png)

Click 'Clone an existing space' dropdown where you can look up the space to use as a template. When all the required information is entered, click the now active 'Clone space' button:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Space visibility and readme files are unavailable when a space is created based on an other. Both of these will be copied over from the template to the newly created one.
{% endhint %}
