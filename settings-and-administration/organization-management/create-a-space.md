# Create a space

{% hint style="info" %}
Only organization managers and faculty members are allowed to create spaces.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## To create a new space

1. Navigate to the dashboard view via the home icon from the breadcrumbs in the top toolbar.\

2. Decide on the type of space you want to create: course, research project, or a dataset.
   * To create a course, select courses from the left sidebar.
   * To create a research project, select research projects.
   * To create a dataset, select datasets.\

3. Assume we want to create a course. Then by clicking on the school hat icon in the sidebar, the list of courses will be displayed. From the top right, click "NEW COURSE".\

4. Provide the name of the space, select the space type, and provide a description of the space. You can also initialize the space from [GitHub](create-a-space/clone-a-github-repository.md) or [another space](create-a-space/clone-an-existing-space.md). Once all done, click ADD SPACE. The private course is going to be called "Demo class" in this example.\

5. Once the space is created, an optional step asks you whether you want to create an application in the newly created space. To skip this step, click on "SKIP THIS STEP". In this example, we create an RStudio application with R 3.6.1 version and call it "Demo RStudio".  When done, clicking "ADD APPLICATION" takes you to the next screen.\

6. Finally, you will be redirected to a view where you can decide what to do next: add files, open the application you have just created, or invite users.
