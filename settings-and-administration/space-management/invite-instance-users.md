# Invite instance users

{% hint style="info" %}
* At the instance level, there are two types of permission that can be granted: instance editor and instance viewer. For details on the types of rights each of these roles has, please read [here](../../our-features/data-organization/instances.md).
* Before granting access rights to an instance, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only space administrators are allowed to grant access right for an instance.
{% endhint %}

## **To invite a new instance user:**

    1. Open a space \(course or research project\). In the following example, we open the course called "Demo Space".
