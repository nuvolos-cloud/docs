# Budgets

As resource pools are associated with a list of spaces, organizations and resources, it is possible to create budgets for colleagues that share funding by setting up a resource pool for each budget. This page details some standard use cases.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that users cannot create resource pools in a self-service manner. Please reach out to us if you would like to originate a new resource pool - we will discuss with you your use case and offer you the most efficient layout based on your needs.

### Multiple organizations in one resource pool

It is possible to create a single resource pool that is being used by multiple organizations. This is useful if:

* The subscriber entity is very large and would like to split its Nuvolos object layout into multiple organizations.
* The subscriber entity is a conglomerate of loosely related sub-units.

### Research team with personal budgets

It is possible to create personal budgets for your research team members. 

* The research team has its own organization.
* Each member will have their own resource pool, which is mapped to a set of spaces only.

### Research team with shared resources and personal budget on a particular resource

It is possible to create personal budgets for your research team members for only a particular resource type \(in practice this is likely to be high-performance computing or data storage\). 

* The research team has its own organization. 
* Each member has their own space which is generally mapped to the main resource pool.
* The personal resource is mapped to a separate resource pool for each team member.
