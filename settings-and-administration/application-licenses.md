# Application licenses

## Onboard new application types or new licenses

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating an application, you can pick from a list of application types and versions that are available to the particular space and organization as your current context.
{% endhint %}

To increase the available list of application types:

1. Please notify us at [support@nuvolos.cloud](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud) if you need an application that is currently not on the list of available types.
2. For applications that need a commercial license to function, we have a _Bring-Your-Own-License _model. Please contact us at [support@nuvolos.cloud](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud) for discussing technical details of bringing the license to Nuvolos.
