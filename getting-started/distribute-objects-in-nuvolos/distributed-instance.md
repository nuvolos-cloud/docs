description: The distributed instance accumulates distributions in a space

# Distributed instance

The distributed instance is a special [instance](../../our-features/data-organization/instances.md) that exists in every space. It serves the purpose of accumulating [distributions](../../our-features/distribution.md) of the space. The distributed instance is particularly useful in the context of education as it is possible to spawn new student instances from the distributed instance.

The distributed instance has a number of special properties that distinguish it from regular instances.

### Changing the content of the distributed instance

The distributed instance has special content access and modification rules:

* It is only possible to push content to the distributed instance via distribution.
* It is currently **not** possible to delete specific objects from the distributed instance. If you need to delete from the distributed instance, please contact our support.

### Access of the distributed instance

All editors of all instances of a particular space have a viewer role on the distributed instance. As a consequence it is possible for any editor to distribute to their own instance from the distributed instance of the space.
