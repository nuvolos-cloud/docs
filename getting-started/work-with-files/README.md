# Work with files

In all of the following operations, we assume that you know how to pick the appropriate context for your work \(that is, finding the current state of an instance in which you are implicitly or explicitly an editor\).

As an example:

![Finding files in a specific instance](../../.gitbook/assets/pick_context_ed.gif)

## Create a folder

After navigating to the files view of the instance you are working in:



## Upload files



## Download files



## Delete files



## Rename files
