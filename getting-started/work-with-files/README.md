# Work with files

In all of the following operations, we assume that you know how to pick the appropriate context for your work \(that is, finding the current state of an instance in which you are implicitly or explicitly an editor\).

As an example:

![Finding files in a specific instance](../../.gitbook/assets/pick_context_ed.gif)

## Create a folder

After navigating to the files view of the instance you are working in:

![Creating a folder](../../.gitbook/assets/create_folder_ed.gif)

## Upload files

You can upload files and folders with the upload button.

![Uploading an entire folder with contents using drag and drop](../../.gitbook/assets/upload_folder_ed.gif)

## Download files

You can download a file by selecting it and finding the download button:

![Downloading a file](../../.gitbook/assets/download_file_ed%20%281%29.gif)

## Delete files

You can delete one or more files by selecting them and then finding the delete button.

## The readme feature

If you create a file named README.md in a folder, the user interface of Nuvolos will try to interpret and render it as a markdown file. As an example:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/readme.png)
