As visible in the animation, you can choose to add an application to the class immediately upon setup, or delay this step to a later time.

## Adding teaching material

By teaching material, we generally understand code and documents that are stored as files on your machine. The following animation shows you how to navigate to the files of the master instance and upload some material.

## Distributing to prospective students

You can distribute the teaching material to prospective and existing students by using the distribute feature. For a very basic use case, we demonstrate how to distribute the two files uploaded previously.
