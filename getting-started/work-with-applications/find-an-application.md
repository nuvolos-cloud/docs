# Find an application

**To find an application in Nuvolos, there are three options:**

1- If you are searching for an application that you have recently worked with, then you can navigate to the dashboard and you will be able to see the three most recent applications you have worked with. From there you can open the application.

2- If the application you are looking for is running, then you can use the desktop monitor icon from the toolbar to find your application

3- To view the full list of applications you have in a class or a research project, then open the class and then use the toolbar to navigate to the applications list. 

For example, if we want to see the list of applications available in the class called "Demo Space", then we first open the space:

Then from the left sidebar, click on the desktop monitor icon and you will see the apps:
