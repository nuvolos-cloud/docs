## Researcher: Can I use \[Software package x\]?

It depends. Our applications come with the conda package manager pre-installed. You can try to install your software package via conda, see our [guide](../getting-started/work-with-applications/install-a-software-package.md) for more details.

If the package cannot be installed via self-service, then please contact us at [**support@nuvolos.cloud**](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud).

## Researcher: Is git supported?

Yes, git is supported via applications. In any application you can start, **git and git-lfs is available on the command line** of your application.

## Researcher: Is Dropbox supported?

Currently no. We are working on Dropbox integration and we expect this feature to be implemented by the end of 2020.
