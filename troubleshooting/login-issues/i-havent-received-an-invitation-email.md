# I haven't received the invitation email

#### If, after being invited to join Nuvolos, you don’t receive an invitation email, here are some fixes you can try.

* Check the Spam or Junk Mail folder. 
* Search for an email with the title “**Nuvolos has sent you an invitation**”. 
* Wait a few minutes for the invitation email to arrive. 
* Contact the class/project administrator to make sure that she included you in the list of invitees and that she used the correct email.

#### None of these steps worked—what shall I do next?

If you've tried each of the fixes mentioned above, and still don't receive the invitation email, please contact us at **support@alphacruncher.com.**
