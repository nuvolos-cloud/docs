# I forgot my e-mail address for sign-in

#### If you don't remember anymore the email address you used to create your Nuvolos account, then consider one of the following solutions:

* If you can log in to Nuvolos with your username (rather than the email), then once logged in click on the account icon on the top right of the toolbar -> select "Settings" and you should be able to find your email.\

* Try the email address of your current organization as this is very likely to be the one used when your Nuvolos account was created.\

* Search your institutional or personal emails for an email with the words “**Nuvolos has sent you an invitation**”. You are very likely to have used one of these emails in joining Nuvolos.\

* Try to contact your organization manager or space administrator and ask if he/she can provide you with the email address they used to add you to Nuvolos.\


**None of these steps worked—what shall I do next?**
