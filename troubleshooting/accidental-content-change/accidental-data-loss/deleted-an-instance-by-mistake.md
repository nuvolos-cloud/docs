# Deleted an instance

DataHub has a standard retention period of 1 day \(24 hours\) for all data items. Therefore, when you delete an instance, it will disappear from your list of instance, but DataHub will preserve it in the backend for 24 hours. This means that within 24 hours you will be able to restore your deleted instance and resume work with it.

If you have accidentally deleted an instance, and you want to recover it, please contact us within 24 hours at **support@alphacruncher.com.**
