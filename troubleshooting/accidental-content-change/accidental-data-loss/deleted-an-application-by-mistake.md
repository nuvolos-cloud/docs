# Deleted an application

Nuvolos has a standard retention period of 1 day \(24 hours\) for all data items. Therefore, when you delete an application, it will disappear from your list of applications, but Nuvolos will preserve it for 24 hours. This means that within 24 hours you will be able to restore your deleted application and resume work with it.

If you have accidentally deleted an application, and you want to recover it, please contact us within 24 hours at [**support@nuvolos.cloud**](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud)**.**
