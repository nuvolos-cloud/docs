## Instructor: What is the value-add of Nuvolos to my workflow?

The benefit of Nuvolos is mainly felt in digital education workflows. To name a few benefits:

* Distribution of teaching material is made simpler via the distribute feature. Just upload or generate content directly on Nuvolos, then distribute and your students will receive what they need exactly when they are supposed to need it. 
* **It is simple to maintain identical environments for all of your students** throughout the course of a semester. Package and teaching material updates can be distributed at the same time as a complete operation. 
* Students can use a controlled environment, however they have fairly large freedom compared to most controlled environments.  
* Managing participants of your class is made easier. 
* You receive technical support. If you run into an issue related to the application you are using, please contact us at [**support@nuvolos.cloud**](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud).
