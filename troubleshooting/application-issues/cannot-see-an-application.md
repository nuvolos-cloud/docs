# I can't see an application

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you're having trouble finding a specific application, here are some issues you can examine:

* **The application you are looking for is not among the ones visualized by default.**

By default, the list of applications will show only ten apps. If you cannot find an application, then it might be because it is now shown in the first 10 items. Simply increase the number of rows per page using the option at the bottom of the table, or navigate to the next page by using the right arrow at the bottom.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

[Here](../../actions/find-objects-in-nuvolos/find-an-application.md) you can find information on how to find an application in Nuvolos.

* **You don't have the right permission to view the application**

To view an application, you need to be an instance editor or a viewer of an instance. Instance viewers cannot see the applications in the CURRENT STATE, only those in a snapshot. If you don't have the right permission to view the snapshots of an instance, you can ask the instance editor to invite you to become an instance editor which will allow you to view the application.

* **The application does not exist anymore because it was deleted.**

An application might disappear because the instance editor deleted it or the snapshot that contained it wa deleted.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the list of applications from the server. Make sure you restore your connection and refresh the page.

* **There has been a server-side error and the list of applications was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the application data is not served properly. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and then check again.
