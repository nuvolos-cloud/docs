# I can't start an application

#### If, after logging into the DataHub, you're having trouble starting an application, here are some issues you can examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to start the application**

To start an application in an instance, you need to be the editor of that instance. Instance viewers cannot start or stop applications. If you don't have the right permission to start an application, contact the instance editor and ask her to grant you permission, or you can go to one of the instances of which you are an editor and start one of your applications.

* **Give it some time.**

Starting an application might require several seconds, please wait for some time until it starts.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

To start an application, you must be in the **CURRENT STATE** of an instance of which you are an editor. 

* **There is no application to start.**

Make sure that you have created the application before starting it. If you haven't created the application yet, then [create](../../actions/instance-management/create-an-application.md) one first and then start it.

* **The application you want to start does not exist anymore because it was deleted.**

An application might disappear because the instance editor deleted it. If you are the instance editor, then you can [recover](../authorization-issues/accidental-data-loss/deleted-an-application-by-mistake.md) the deleted application within 24 hours of the deletion time. If you are not the instance editor, then you can contact the editor and ask if the application or snapshot could be restored.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the data needed to start the application. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page and try to start the application again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the application start data was not properly served by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the application data is not served properly, making it impossible to start the application. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and then try to start the application.
