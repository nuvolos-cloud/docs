# I can't see an instance

#### If, after logging into the DataHub, you're having trouble finding a specific instance, here are some issues you can consider:

* **The instance you are looking for is not among the spaces visualized by default.**

By default, the list of instances will show only five instances. If you cannot find an instance then it might be because it is now shown in the first five items. Simply increase the number of rows per page using the option at the bottom of the table, or navigate to the next page by using the right arrow at the bottom.

* **You are not member of the space which contains the instance.**

Instances live within a space. In order to view an instance you need to at least have a viewer role that allows you to view the instance. If you don't have the right permission, consider contacting the space admin to grant you a viewer role/

* **The instance does not exist anymore because it was deleted.**

An instance might disappear because the space admin deleted it. If you are the space admin, then you can [recover](accidental-data-loss/deleted-an-instance-by-mistake.md) the deleted instance within 24 hours of the deletion time. If you are not the space admin, then you can contact the space admin and ask if the instance could be restored.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the list of instances from the server. Make sure you restore your connection and refresh the page.

* **There has been a server-side error and the list of instances was not properly served by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that space data is not served properly. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and check again.
