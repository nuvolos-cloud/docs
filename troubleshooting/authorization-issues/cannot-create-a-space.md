# I can't create a space

#### If you're having problems creating a new space, here are some issues you might want to examine:

* **You are not member of the organization where you want to create a space.**

Spaces live within an organization. In order to create a space you need to be part of the organization.

* **You followed the wrong steps for creating a space**

Make sure you follow the correct steps required for creating a space. For more details, check [here](../../settings-and-administration/organization-management/create-a-space.md).

* **You do not have the permission to create a space**

In order to create a space, the user must have an org manager or faculty role. If you don't have the required role to create a space, you can contact your org manager or a faculty and ask them to create the space. 

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, your request to create a space might not be received by the server. Make sure you restore your connection, refresh the page and try to create the space again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the space creation request was not properly processed by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the request to create a space is not processed properly by the server. Please wait for some time and then try create the space again.
