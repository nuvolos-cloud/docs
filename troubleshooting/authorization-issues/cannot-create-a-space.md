# I can't create a space

#### If you're having problems creating a new space, here are some issues you might want to examine:

* **The space name is already taken**

Space names have to be unique in an organization, to avoid confusion. Note that it is possible a space with a given name already exists in an organization, but you don't see it because case it's private and you were not given access to it. Please use a different name to proceed.

* **You don't have the right permission to create a space.**

To be able to create a space in an organization you need to be an **organization manager** or **faculty member**. If you don't have any of these roles, then contact the organization manager to send you an invitation for a faculty or organization manager role, or ask the organization manager to set up a space for you.

* **You followed the wrong steps for creating a space.**

Make sure you follow the correct steps required for creating a space. For more details, check [here](../../settings-and-administration/organization-management/create-a-space/).

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, your request to create a space might not be received by the server. Make sure you restore your connection, refresh the page, and try to create the space again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the space creation request was not properly processed by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the request to create a space is not processed properly by the server. Please wait for some time and then try to create the space again.
