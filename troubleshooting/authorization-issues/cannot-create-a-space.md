# I can't create a space

#### If you're having problems creating a new space, here are some issues you might want to examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to create a space**

To be able to create a space in an organization you need to be an organization manager or faculty. If you don't have any of these roles, then contact the org manager to send you an invitation for faculty or org manager role.

* **You followed the wrong steps for creating a space**

Make sure you follow the correct steps required for creating a space. For more details, check [here](../../actions/organization-management/create-a-space.md).

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, your request to create a space might not be received by the server. Make sure you restore your connection, refresh the page and try to create the space again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the space creation request was not properly processed by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the request to create a space is not processed properly by the server. Please wait for some time and then try create the space again.
