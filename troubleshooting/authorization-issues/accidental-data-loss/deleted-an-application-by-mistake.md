# Deleted an application

DataHub has a standard retention period of 1 day \(24 hours\) for all data items. Therefore, when you delete an application, it will disappear from your list of applications, but DataHub will preserve it in the backend for 24 hours. This means that within 24 hours you will be able to restore your deleted application and resume work with it.

If you have accidentally deleted an application, and you want to recover it, please contact us within 24 hours at **support@alphacruncher.com.**
