# I can't see distributed content in my instance

**If you expect to see new content in your instance because another member has shared a snapshot with you but you are having trouble finding the new content, here are some issues you can examine:** 

* **You don't have the right permission.**

When a snapshot is shared with another instance, then the new contents will be merged with the contents of the current state of the target instance. In order to view the current state of an instance, you need to be the editor of the instance. If you don't have the right permission to see the current state of an instance, then you can ask the instance editor who shared the original data to share the same data with one of the instances of which you are an editor. As an alternative, the editor might create a snapshot of the updated current state for you to view.

* **Refresh your page.**

In order to see the new contents, you might need to refresh the page so that the browser receives the new updated data which will visualize the new contents.

* **Give it some time.**

Merging the contents of your current state with the newly shared contents might take some time. Please wait for a few more seconds, refresh your page and then check again.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

To see the shared, you must be in the **CURRENT STATE** of the instance with which the content was shared. If you are not sure which instance received the new data, contact the person who shared the data with you and ask him to indicate which instance they shared the data with.

* **You restored a previous snapshot**

If, after having received shared contents from another member, you restore one of your snapshots, then the contents of the current state will be completely replaced by the contents of the restored snapshot. If you have accidentally restored a snapshot, check [here](../accidental-content-change/restored-a-snapshot-by-mistake.md) for how to revert this operation.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the browser might not receive the new updated data from the server and therefore you won't see the new contents. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page and check again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the data sharing process did not succeed.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the data sharing was not processed successfully by the server. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and check again. If you still don't see the content, contact the person who shared the data with you and ask her if the data was shared successfully.
