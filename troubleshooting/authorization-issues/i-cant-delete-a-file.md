# I can't delete a file

#### If, after logging into the DataHub, you have trouble deleting one or more files, here are some issues you can examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to delete files.**

To delete a file in an instance, you need to be an editor of that instance. Instance viewers cannot delete files. If you don't have the right permission to delete a file, you can ask the instance editor to do it, or ask for an invitation to become an instance editor which allows you to delete files.

* **You followed the wrong steps for deleting files.**

Make sure you follow the correct steps required for deleting files. For more details, check [here]().

* **Give it some time.**

Deleting  files might take several seconds, please wait for some time until the operation is completed.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

To delete files, you must be in the **CURRENT STATE** of an instance of which you are an editor. Once in the current state, click on **Files** button from the side bar on the left, select the files you want to delete, and then click the **DELETE** button from the file list table.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the file deletion operation might fail. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page and try to delete the files again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the file deletion request was not properly processed by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the file deletion request is not processed properly by DataHub. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and then try to delete the files again.
