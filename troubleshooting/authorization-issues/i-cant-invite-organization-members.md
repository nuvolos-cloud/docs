# I can't invite organization members

#### If, after logging into the DataHub, you're having trouble inviting organization members, here are some issues you can examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to invite organization members.**

To invite new organization members, you need to be a manager of the organization. Check the documentation [here](../../settings-and-administration/know-my-role.md) to know where to find your organization role. If you don't have an organization manager role, you either ask an org manager to grant you a manager role, or ask the manager to send the organization member invitation on your behalf.

* **One or more of the provided emails is invalid.**

If you provide a user email that is invalid, e.g. **myemail@.uni.edu.com**, then you won't be able to send the invitation request until you fix the typos or errors in these invalid emails.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the user invitation request might not reach the server and therefore the invitations might not be sent. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page and try to invite the users again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the invitation request was not properly served by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the invitation request is not processed properly, making it impossible to invite organization members. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and then try to invite the users again.
