# I can't see a space

#### If, after logging into the DataHub, you have trouble finding a specific space, the following issues could occur.

* **The space you are looking for is not among the spaces visualized by default.**

By default, the list of spaces will show only five spaces. If you cannot find a space then it might be because it is now shown in the first five items. Simply increase the number of rows per page using the option at the bottom of the table, or navigate to the next page by using the right arrow at the bottom..

* **You are not member of the organization hosting the space.**

Spaces are contained in an organization. In order to view a space you need to be part of the organization and have a role that allows you to view the space. To view a space, you need to be one of the following: organization manager, a faculty member, an affiliated member with the organization, or an external member who has been invited to join a space. If you are not a member of the organization, you can ask the space administrator to send you an invitation to join.

* **The space does not exist anymore because it was deleted.**

A space might disappear because the space administrator deleted it. If you are the space administrator, then you can [recover](accidental-data-loss/deleted-a-space-by-mistake.md) the deleted space within 24 hours of the deletion time. If you are not the space admin, then you can contact the space admin and ask if the space could be restored.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the list of spaces from the server. Make sure you restore your connection and refresh the page.

* **There has been a server-side error and the list of spaces was not properly served by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that space data is not served properly. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and then try again.
