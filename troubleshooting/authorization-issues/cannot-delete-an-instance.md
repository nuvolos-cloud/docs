# I can't delete an instance

#### If you're having problems deleting an instance, here are some issues you might want to examine:

* **You do not have the permission to delete an instance**

In order to delete an instance, the user must have a space admin. If you don't have the necessary role to delete an instance, you can ask the instance editor to delete the instance, or invite you to become an instance editor which allows you to delete the instance.

* **You are viewing the Master or Distributed instance.**

The Master and Distributed instances are primary instances that must exist for each space and they cannot be deleted.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, your request to delete an instance might not be received by the server. Make sure you restore your connection, refresh the page and try to delete the instance again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the instance deletion request was not properly processed by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the instance deletion request is not processed properly by DataHub. Please wait for some time and then try to delete the instance again.
