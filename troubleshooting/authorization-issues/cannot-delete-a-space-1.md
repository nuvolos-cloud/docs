# I can't delete a space

#### If you're having problems deleting a space, here are some issues you might want to examine:

* **You are not member of the organization where you want to delete a space.**

Spaces live within an organization. In order to delete a space you need to be part of the organization.

* **You do not have the permission to delete a space**

In order to delete a space, the user must have an org manager or faculty role. If you don't have the necessary role to create a space, you can contact your org manager or a faculty and discuss with them the deletion of the space.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, your request to delete a space might not be received by the server. Make sure you restore your connection, refresh the page and try to delete the space again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the space deletion request was not properly processed by DataHub.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the space deletion request is not processed properly by DataHub. Please wait for some time and then try to delete the space again.
