# I can't distribute a snapshot

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you're having trouble distributing a snapshot to other instances, here are some issues you can examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to distribute a snapshot.**

To distribute a snapshot from one instance to another, you need to be the editor of _both_ instances. An instance editor will not be able to distribute a snapshot to an instance where she is a viewer.

* **You are following the wrong steps.**

To distribute a snapshot, follow the steps detailed [here](../../actions/distribute-objects-in-nuvolos/).

* **One or more of the target instances have been deleted.**  Make sure that the instance\(s\) you are distributing to do exist. 
* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the snapshot distribution request might not reach the server and therefore the snapshot might not be distributed. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page and try to distribute the snapshot again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the snapshot distribution data was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the distribute request is not processed properly, making it impossible to distribute the snapshot. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and then try to distribute the snapshot again.
