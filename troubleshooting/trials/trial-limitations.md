# Trial limitations

If you don't have an account yet, you can try out Nuvolos anytime with a [Free Trial](https://nuvolos.cloud/go-to-free-trial). In the free trial, you'll become the Space Administrator of your sandbox space, with some prepopulated data.

While the Free Trial enables you to test the most important features of Nuvolos, like scaling you application resources using Alphacruncher Credits (AC), trying any apps or inviting collaborators, certain limitations apply:

* Creation of new spaces is not allowed
* Taking [snapshots ](../../our-features/snapshotting.md)is not allowed
* [Distribution ](../../our-features/distribution.md)of apps is not allowed
* [Inactivity timeout](../../education/instructor-topics/performance.md#configuring-application-inactivity-timeout) cannot be changed  (1 hour/app)
* Trial apps are [stopped automatically](../../getting-started/work-with-applications/long-running-applications.md#automatic-stopping-due-to-inactivity) after one hour of inactivity, even if they're actively computing
* [NCU settings](../../education/instructor-topics/performance.md#configuring-application-resources) cannot be changed (2 NCU/app)
