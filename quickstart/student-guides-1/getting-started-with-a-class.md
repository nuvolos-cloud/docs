# Getting started with a class

## **To get started with a class, here are the steps to follow:**

## 1. **Accept invitation.**

Access to a class is by invitation only. The class instructor invites prospective participants by email. To accept, click on the **Review** **Invitation** button.

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**In case you haven't received an invitation email, please check the troubleshooting documentation available** [**here**](../../troubleshooting/login-issues/i-havent-received-an-invitation-email.md)**.**

Several options are currently available to accept the invitation. If you are a member of a Swiss academic institution \(e.g. University of Lugano\), choose the option “**I have a Swiss University account**” and sign in with your institution credentials. Contingent on successful authentication, the invitation is confirmed, and sign-in to class happens automatically.

## 2. Start application

The Nuvolos Dashboard home page provides useful at-a-glance information about the status of your applications and your membership in [organizations](http:///@alphacruncher-1/s/datahub/~/drafts/-LpMzyPUrAQ03FcWCTT_/primary/data-organization/organizations). Use the links on the right side of each application to manage it, e.g. to  **START** or **STOP** it. The screenshot below exemplifies an RStudio application deployed and ready to start.

## ​3. Open and work with files from the application.

Teaching material, e.g. example code or assignments, can be distributed by the instructor of the class. Such content becomes available in your working directory \(the default working directory is /files\). For example, you are working with an RStudio application with content available inside a folder called **week\_01**. In the bottom right pane of the RStudio application choose the **FILES** tab to see the available material \(similar to the screenshot below\). Clicking on the R file, you will be able to see and work with it in the R console.
