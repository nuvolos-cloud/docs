# Workflow guides

A variety of academic activities involve storing and sharing of files, code, tables and applications bundled together or separately. These activities include teaching an analytical course, conducting empirical or data-driven analysis, collaborating with multiple colleagues on a research project or teaching a summer school. Efficiently organising and managing all of the data, applications and code with the minimal time and resources is increasingly becoming a challenging problem.

Nuvolos offers the best solution to overcome this problem. **With Nuvolos, it is possible to:**

1. **Store files, data, code and applications** using a user-friendly, browser-based platform.  
2. **Share files, data, code and applications** with colleagues or students, without having to worry about differences of operating systems, missing packages, or lack of computation or storage capacity. It's all done in the browser, with guaranteed scalability and zero maintenance. 
3. **Host subscription-based datasets** in a secure way and invite others to view and interact with them.  
4. **Teach interactive classes** more efficiently. Nuvolos ensures that students will receive the same and complete environments minimizing overhead. Nuvolos makes it possible to disseminate teaching material efficiently. 
5. **Conduct research projects** in a safer, reproducible and simple-to-organize way. Nuvolos makes it possible to create branches and immutable versions of the research work. Immutable versions encapsulate the complete state of the work at a given point in time. Nuvolos ensures that running the same point-in-time state will replicate exact results.
