# Introduction

Nuvolos is a unified cloud framework for research and education that allows you to store, version, and work with files, tables, code and applications in one place via a user-friendly, browser-based interface.

Nuvolos offers a scalable, operating-system independent solution, with no maintenance required. This allows for a more efficient and organized framework for sharing data, code, and application configuration with colleagues and students. In this way, students and researcher can get right into the challenges that really matter, without any setup overhead.

Users of Nuvolos can upload and work with their data files as well as work with terabytes of subscription data inside database tables. Users can organize and document their research projects and courses via Spaces, and gather everything they need for a given project into a single location.

With Nuvolos, users will be able to version everything their project depends on in order to ensure there are no loose ends for reproducibility. Users can create point-in-time snapshots of their complete environment: data \(files and tables\), code and applications, to ensure that results they produce today will be reproducible in the future. Researchers who want to build on existing research can obtain a copy of the files needed to produce and extend the research results.
