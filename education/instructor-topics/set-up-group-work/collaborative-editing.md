# Collaborative editing

For JupyterLab 3.1 or higher, Nuvolos support collaborative editing. We recommend that for group instances, a JupyterLab 3.1 application is shared, with "Shared mode" enabled first. This allows multiple students to connect at the same time and edit the files / notebooks together, without causing conflicts when saving.

Steps:

1. Add a JupyterLab 3.1 \(or higher\) application in the master instance.
2. Enable "Shared" mode, by clicking the "Configuration" button on the application list.
3. Distribute the application to the student instances and instruct the students to use it for group work.
