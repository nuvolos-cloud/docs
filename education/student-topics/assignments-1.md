# Assignments

You can work on your assignments in Nuvolos, submit them directly and review the instructor's feedback without having to upload, download or send around files.

### Viewing assignments

If there is an assignment created for the course, you will be able to see it on the space overview dashboard, when you open the space. You will be able to see the submission deadline \(always displayed in UTC time\) and whether you have submitted a hand-in for the assignment.

If you click on the assignment, you will be able to see the files of the assignment. These files will be distributed to you by the instructor and you can find them inside your application as regular files.

### Working on assignments

To work on assignments, you need to work on the files that are part of the assignment. Once you are satisfied with your state, make sure you saved all the files and then can proceed to hand-in the assignment.

### Handing in assignments

To hand-in an assignment, click on the assignment on the dashboard and then click on the "Hand-in" button on the top right of the dialog. 

All files in the assignment **have to exist at submission time**, otherwise your submission will fail. You can check your submission status at the bell symbol at the top right of the Nuvolos web UI.

You can submit multiple times for the same assignment until the assignment deadline has passed. The instructor will see all your submissions organised in different folders in chronological order.

Once you have handed in your assignment, you will be able to see the **read-only** handed in copy in the **Assignments &gt; handin** folder inside your application.

{% hint style="info" %}
The handed in version of the files \(under the files &gt; Assignments folder\) are only visible from the application and currently cannot be downloaded from the web-interface.

You will be able to see however a list of your past submissions if you click on the assignment.
{% endhint %}

### Reviewing feedback

Once the instructor has reviewed your work, they will enable you to see the hand-back version of the files. Start your application \(if it was already running, then re-start it\) and in the **Assignments &gt; handback** folder you will see a read-only copy of the reviewed / graded file, with the appropriate comments from the instructor.
