# Assignments

You can work on your assignments in Nuvolos, submit them directly and review the instructor's feedback without having to upload, download or send around files.

### Viewing assignments

If there is an assignment created for the course, you will be able to see it on the space overview dashboard, when you open the space. You will be able to see the submission deadline and whether you have submitted a hand-in for the assignment.

If you click on the assignment, you will be able to see the files of the assignment. These files will be distributed to you by the instructor and you can find them inside your application as regular files.

### Working on assignments

To work on assignments, you need to work on the files that are part of the assignment. Once you are satisfied with your state, make sure you saved all the files and then can proceed to hand-in the assignment.

### Handing in assignments

To hand-in an assignment, click on the assignment on the dashboard and then click on the "Hand-in" button on the top right of the dialog. 

All files in the assignment **have to exist at submission time**, otherwise, your submission will fail. You can check your submission status on the tasks page \(bell symbol at the top right of the Nuvolos web UI\).

**You can submit multiple times** for the same assignment until the assignment deadline has passed. The **instructor will only see your latest hand-in and will grade this version**.

Once you have handed in your assignment, you will be able to see the **read-only** handed in copy in the **Assignments &gt; handin** folder inside your application under the following structure:

```text
Assignments > handin > [assignment_name]> [handin_id]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to check the handin folder from your application after submission to make sure all the files have been successfully submitted with the right version. Don't worry, you cannot modify the files in the handin folder, they are read-only.

The handed in version of the files \(under the files &gt; Assignments folder\) are only visible from the application and currently cannot be downloaded from the web-interface.

You will be able to see however a list of your past submissions if you click on the assignment.
{% endhint %}

### Reviewing feedback

Once the instructor has reviewed your work, they will enable you to see the hand-back version of the files. Click on the Assignment tile to open the Assignment dialog which will show the grade your received. 

You can also launch the application to review the corrected version of your files, which will be available in the following folder:

```text
Assignments > handback > [assignment_name]> [handin_id]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
By default only the latest assignment handback will be visible \(if any\) in a running application. If you wish to review the corrections for an older assignment, stop the application and launch it using the "Review Corrections" button from the assignments dialog which will then show the corrections for the given assignment.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll only see the feedback in the handback folder if the **teacher has made handbacks available.** Only the latest handin will be graded.
{% endhint %}
