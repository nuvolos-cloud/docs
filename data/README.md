# Work with Data

Nuvolos is not just an online computer lab, it is also an online data platform. We offer strong data integration to support modern research and education use cases that rely on large amounts of data. 

As a data platform, Nuvolos integrates strongly with both online \(Nuvolos based\) and offline \(non-Nuvolos based\) applications. Please review our [access documentation](access-data-from-applications/) to learn more. Nuvolos also offers the ability to define data pipelines, and ingest data from various sources. Please reach out to our [support](mailto:support@alphacruncher.com) for more information.
