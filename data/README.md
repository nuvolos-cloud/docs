# Manage Data

## Start working with data

Nuvolos differentiates two types of data:

1. Tabular data stored in some database management system
2. Data stored in regular files

This page describes working with _tabular data. ****_For working with files, consult [our guide](../getting-started/work-with-files/).

## Datasets

Datasets are special kinds of spaces, with the main goal of containing only tabular data and documentation related to that tabular data and potentially other descriptor files. For obtaining a full list of the datasets available to you in your current organization, navigate to your dashboard and pick the datasets menu.

It is important to understand in the above that datasets consist of immutable snapshots.



Working with data in Nuvolos comprises of a number of components:

1. [Getting data to a work instance](add-data-to-your-working-instance.md)
2. [Accessing data in a work instance via the web interface](the-table-view.md),
3. [Accessing data in a work instance via Nuvolos applications](access-data-from-applications/),
4. [Accessing data in a work instance via non-Nuvolos applications](access-data-from-applications/#accessing-data-in-non-nuvolos-applications).
